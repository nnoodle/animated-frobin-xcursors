# Animated F!Robin cursors port

Ported from the [original animated cursors theme](https://www.deviantart.com/kaz-kirigiri/art/Fire-Emblem-F-Robin-Mouse-Cursors-602262584) made for Windows.

## Installation

Move this directory into your `~/.icons`, so that the cursors folder
is in `~/.icons/animated-frobin-xcursors/cursors`. The cursor theme
should now appear in the cursor theme settings of your desktop
environment, for example:

### In GNOME

Open `gnome-tweaks` and the "Cursor" option should be in the
Appearance tab that it starts up in.

### Without a Desktop Environment

Put this into your `.Xresources` and reload it.
```conf
Xcursor.theme: animated-frobin-xcursors
```
